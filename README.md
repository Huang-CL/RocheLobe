# RocheLobe
The shape of Roche Lobe vs mass ratio.
x direction pointing away from the companion star. y toward orbital motion. z is pointing north.
1. The L1 over separation ratio vs masses ratio (L1.pdf). 
2. The ratio of Roche lobe in y/x and z/x to illustrate the shape of the Roche lobe (Ratio.pdf).
3. The location of maximum potential point along y axis in the unit of separation a vs masses ratio (Pot_ymin.pdf).
4. Contour of potential in the x-y plane (potential_xy.pdf).
5. Contour of potential in the x-z plane (potential_xz.pdf).
6. Compare the shape of equal potential surface with a elliptical (Equal_potential_yz.pdf).
